// This class is used to determine whether or not Reactions
// should happen.  Instances of Condition exist in two places:
// as assets which are part of the AllConditions asset and as
// part of ConditionCollections.  The Conditions that are part
// of the AllConditions asset are those that are set by
// Reactions and reflect the state of the game.  Those that
// are on ConditionCollections are compared to the
// AllConditions asset to determine whether other Reactions
// should happen.
